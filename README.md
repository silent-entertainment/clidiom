# clidiom
A counterpart to the `claxiom` project, `clidiom` is the implementation of a new programming language that is an adaptation of a very old language. I'm going to keep it under wraps for now, because you'll call me a `clidiot` if I let the rat out of the cage too soon. When the time comes, you'll probably still call me a clever idiot.

`Clidiom` is a portmanteau of clever idiom-I just can't help myself! Though the project currently has no files for public consumption, it's in the pipeline, and the project deserved to be the first project on github to claim the title.

Stay tuned, because I'm going to rock your world. 

*Yeah, yeah. Promises, promises.*

I'm sure that you're on the edge of your seat right now. Don't fall off.

*Hey, why is he talking to himself?*

*I don't know!*

## The Premise

Okay, so I exagerrated just a wee bit. It isn't exactly a new idea, but I'm seeing a new opportunity. Here's the scoop. We're going to build up natural language into something that can be compiled and executed by breaking it down interactively in a `claxium notebook`, recording the output, analyzing the results to see what goes wrong and then giving the compiler hints to refine the rules or in cases where that doesn't work we'll define explicit rules. Lather, rinse and repeat.

A lot of this has been done before, and there is a large body of work on which to build, and there are many available tools. I'm seeing the notebook format as a potentially promising avenue for exploration of the subject, because the notebook records the flow of thoughts and of the interaction in a manner that can foster more ideas. This is the experiment in a nutshell.

I started this exploration over 20 years ago. Life took over. The project was put aside. The collaborative collection of knowledge has advanced very far in those decades. It's time.

Recently, I was doing some research in robotics for a personal project, and I came across some robotic programs that are coined sketches. I have always enjoyed pondering words. I'll look them up in the dictionary and the thesaurus, often exploring etymologies and following leads to other words. I ruminated about the use of the word sketch, and when I decided to take up this old dusty project the word sketch came to mind, because what we're doing here and in any coding project in any programming language is defining sketches.

This leads us to the definition of the new claxiom notebook cell type, the `sketch`. More later...
