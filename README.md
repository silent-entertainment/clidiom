# clidiom
A counterpart to the claxiom project, clidiom is a new programming language that is an adaptation of a very old language. I'm going to keep it under wraps for now, because you'll call me a clidiot if I let the rat out of the cage too soon. When the time comes, you'll probably still call me a clever idiot.

Clidiom is a portmanteau of clever idiom-I just can't help myself! Though the project currently has no files for public consumption, it's in the pipeline, and the project deserved to be the first project on github to claim the title.

Stay tuned, because I'm going to rock your world. 

*Yeah, yeah. Promises, promises.*

I'm sure that you're on the edge of your seat right now. Don't fall off.
